# XtremePython 2023
This repository contains the source code for my talk in The XtremePython 2023 Online Conference.

## Talk details
* **Title:** Making your network ready for Cyber Forensics Analysis
* **Abstract:** When a cybercrime occurs, the cyber forensics team must collect digital evidence. In most cases, the evidence is not present in the system as the system is not made ready for evidence collection, and in turn for cyber forensics. In this talk, we will look at what it means to make a system or a network ready for cyber forensics. We will also see them in action in a demo.
